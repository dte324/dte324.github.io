I webscraped 500+ recently sold home listings using Python and created three regression models in R for three towns in Loudoun County, VA. I then created a primitive website using HTML and JavaScript to allow you to input characteristics of your home to receive a predicted home value. Please note that this was created in June 2020, and home prices have changed significantly since then.

Check out the website [here](https://dte324.github.io/Loudoun-Real-Estate/)!

The GitHub repository for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/dte324/Loudoun-Real-Estate).
