Hi, my name is Daniel Eisert, and I am currently a Data Scientist at the MITRE Corporation. My interests are in data analytics, data visualizations, and statistical methods. I have two Bachelorâ€™s of Science from Virginia Tech in [Computational Modeling & Data Analytics](https://www.ais.science.vt.edu/academics/cmda.html) (CMDA) and [Statistics](https://www.stat.vt.edu/). I am currently working towards my Master's of Science in [Business Analytics](https://online.mason.wm.edu/msba) from Willim & Mary. In my free time, I enjoy running (a lot), hiking, and casual biking.

## Interesting Projects
- [Eastern Loudoun Real Estate Calculator](https://dte324.github.io/Loudoun-Real-Estate/index.html) I webscraped 500+ recently sold home listings using Python and created three regression models in R for three towns in Loudoun County, VA. I then created this primitive website using HTML and JavaScript to allow you to input characteristics of your home to receive a predicted home value. Please note that this was created in June 2020, and home prices have changed significantly since then.
